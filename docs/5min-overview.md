## What is Alephium?

**Scalable for devs. Secure for users. Decentralized for all.**

Innovative sharding meets expressive sUTXO and efficient Proof-of-Less-Work to secure scalable dApps for real-world use cases.

---

## Why is Alephium special?

On top of an awesome team, an outstanding community and a lot of energy, here are our technical specificities:

**It scales through sharding**. Alephium is built on a novel and complete sharding algorithm called BlockFlow. It improves on the UTXO model of BTC to make it scalable, and uses DAG data structure to reach consensus between different shards. This will allow up to 10‚Äô000 Transactions Per Second (currently more than 400 TPS vs Bitcoins 7 TPS).

**It is programmable & secure**. Alephium proposes a stateful UTXO model offering layer-1 scalability and the same level of programmability as the account model implemented on ETH, whilst being more secure.

**It is less energy consuming thanks to POLW**. Proof of Less Work combines physical work and Coin economics to dynamically adjust the work required to mine new blocks. Given the same network conditions, Alephium only uses ‚Öõ of the energy compared to Bitcoin.

**It improves on chain structure with its own custom VM (Alphred)**. It resolves many of the critical issues of the current dApps platforms with huge improvements on security, development experience and introductions of new paradigms such as trustless P2P smart contracts transactions.

**It has its own programming language for dApps**. Ralph is similar to the Rust syntax, hence its name. It allows to build efficient and secure smart contracts easier than Solidity for example. It is specifically designed to facilitate the creation of Decentralized Finance applications!

Putting all these innovations together, Alephium delivers a highly demanded solution in the industry: a scalable blockchain improving on mature ideas from Bitcoin to deliver reliable, powerful and secure DeFi and dApps capabilities. And we‚Äôre live!

## Our tokenomics

The token supply on Alephium is limited with a hardcap of 1 billion. At Mainnet Launch (Nov. 8th, 2021), an initial supply of 140M tokens (14% of the hardcap) was mined with the genesis block. The remaining supply of ALPH tokens will be mined over the next ~80 years. Of these 140M tokens:

80M tokens (8%) ü§ù **Pre-sales and future strategic private sales**. Vesting periods varying from 2 to 4 years.

30M tokens (3%) üí° **Community and ecosystem development**. Locked on-chain for 4 years and vested quarterly.

30M tokens (3%) üßë‚Äçüíª **Treasury & Team**. Locked on-chain for 3 years, and vested quarterly.

860M tokens (86%) üåä **Mining Rewards**. These tokens will be used for mining rewards over the next ~80 years. They ensure the processing of transactions and the execution of smart contracts on the Alephium blockchain.

In addition, all the transaction fees are burned with each block and Proof of Less Work enables internal mining cost through burning when the hashrate and energy consumption are significantly high.


### Total Supply and Circulating Supply

The Total Supply is calculated by adding the tokens mined at the Genesis Block (see breakdown above) and the block rewards since the Mainnet Launch.

Alephium uses the CMC method to calculate the circulating supply of ALPH. It consists of: the total number of existing ALPH from which is subtracted the balance (locked & unlocked) from the private sale investors, the treasury, ecosystem, the advisors/contractors, the project-controlled assets and all locked ALPH from other addresses.
In general, you can find our circulating supply on the front page of our [explorer](https://explorer.alephium.org/#/blocks). If you want a more in-depth explanation of the Coin Market Cap methodology, find it [here.](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043396252-Supply-Circulating-Total-Max-)
